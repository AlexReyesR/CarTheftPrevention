The files here are part of the project "Car Theft Prevention", whose purpose is to prevent a car attack or theft through detection of different actions and objects that might lead to it.

The system is based on two different neural networks models: WEAPONS DETECTION and VIOLENT ACTIONS DETECTION, which communicate with a central server and allow to make a conclusion about the possible danger for ther car.
